## Description

**Name**: Digital History and Web Scraping (a hands-on guide to automating primary-source collection and analysis from web sites and social media feeds with Ian Milligan, University of Waterloo)

**Description (2-3 sentences)**: There are so many exciting sources online â€“ but how to find them?This workshop takes attendees through the process of finding sources online, both based on the Web as well as in social media, before briefly discussing various ways to preserve and analyze this material. Most of the class can be done in the web browser, as we explore various source repositories and several web-browser based tools (notably import.io, webrecorder.io), repositories (from Zenodo.org to GitHub.org), the Doc Now web tool for Twitter collection, and analysis tools. The sole piece of software that students should pre install is Outwit Hub Lite (http://www.outwit.com/).

**Downloads**: The only download attendees require is Outwit Hub Lite, a cross-platform piece free tool. It is available at http://www.outwit.com/, or by clicking the download button at http://outwit.com/products/hub/.
