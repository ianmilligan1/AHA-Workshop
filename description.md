## Description

**Name**: Digital History and Web Scraping (a hands-on guide to automating primary-source collection and analysis from web sites and social media feeds with Ian Milligan, University of Waterloo)

**Description (2-3 sentences)**: This workshop takes attendees through the process of finding sources online, both based on the Web as well as in social media, before briefly discussing various ways to preserve and analyze this material. Most of the class can be done in the web browser, as we explore various source repositories and several web-browser based tools (notably import.io, webrecorder.io), repositories (from Zenodo.org to GitHub.org), and analysis tools. The sole piece of software that students should pre install is Outwit Hub Lite (http://www.outwit.com/).
